Method 1: Install the View In Browser plugin â†©
This is the easiest method, but I couldn't get it to work on my Mac. Note that I'm assuming you've installed the Package Control extension for Sublime Text.

Press Command-Shift-P (if you use a Mac) & Ctrl-Shift-P (if you use Windows) to open the Command Palette.

Type Install Package until you see that "Package Control: Install Package" is selected. Press Enter.

In the text box, start typing View In Browser until that package is selected. Once it is, press Enter to install it.

Restart Sublime Text.

Now when you have a web page open in Sublime Text, just press Ctrl-Alt-V & your browser selection tool should open, letting you choose which browser to open.
